// MARK: - SyncTimestampRepositoryImpl

/// Persists the last successful vault sync timestamp to `UserDefaults`.
///
/// - Storage: `UserDefaults`, keyed per account email. Not a secret — no Keychain needed.
/// - Thread safety: implemented as an `actor` (CLAUDE.md: actor for shared mutable state in
///   the Data layer) to guard against concurrent reads/writes from the sync completion path
///   and the ViewModel load path.
/// - Key format: `com.macwarden.lastSyncDate.<email>` — scoped per account so that
///   switching accounts never shows a timestamp from a previous session.
/// - Format: ISO-8601 string via `ISO8601DateFormatter` — human-readable in developer tools.
